# Hands-On Angular 2

## Purpose

This repository is used for my 'Hands-On Angular 2' workshop.

The master branch contains a minimal setup to help you get started with Angular quickly without having to install 
all the dependencies manually (there are a lot of them). 

Also included are some mockups that I created of a very simple mobile app with an overview and detail view, 
made using [Ratchet](http://goratchet.com/). This way you can focus on trying Angular instead of designing all sorts
of brilliant responsive grid systems :p.

All exercises are done in separate branches. The ones that provide useful solutions for future exercises are merged
into the master branch.


## Installation

1. `npm i`
2. `bower i`
3. `gulp watch`

Currently assuming that you run your own local server. Probably I'll add a gulp solution for it soon.
